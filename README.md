# 🧪 OOP Lab 1 – C++  
This repository contains the first lab of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course** using C++ in the ITI 9-Month Program.

## 📌 Lab Overview  
Lab 1 focuses on the **basics of C++ programming** before diving into full OOP concepts.  
It includes hands-on practice with:

- Variables and data types  
- Conditional statements (if/else)  
- Mathematical operations  
- Functions  
- Working with user input/output  

The goal of this lab is to ensure a strong understanding of **C++ fundamentals**, which are essential before starting OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
